# iris-flower
Iris Flower Detector:-
This project is an Iris Flower Detection system that classifies iris flowers into three species based on the physical dimensions of the flowers. The model uses machine learning techniques, specifically the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm, to predict the species of an iris flower.

Dataset:-
The dataset used in this project is the famous Iris Dataset, which contains 150 records of iris flowers and includes four features for each flower:

Sepal length

Sepal width

Petal length

Petal width

These features are used to classify the flowers into one of the following three species:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica

Project Overview
Objective: To build a machine learning model that can predict the species of iris flowers based on their physical measurements.

Algorithm Used: k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

Libraries Used:

Pandas (for data manipulation)

Scikit-learn (for machine learning models and evaluation)

Matplotlib and Seaborn (for data visualization)

NumPy (for numerical operations)

Features
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the Iris dataset for use in the model.

Model Training: Train a k-NN model to classify the flowers.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and other metrics.

Visualization: Generate plots to visualize the relationships between features and the decision boundaries
